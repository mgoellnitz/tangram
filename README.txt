SUMMARY

Tangram is a framework for the object oriented web rendering of java beans. 
It comes with limited CMS functionality by using JDO as a source and presenting 
a more or less generic editor for that situation. JDO can be used in conjunction 
with Google App Engine or stand alone with relational database systems.

Examples are presented for JDO with RDBMS SQLite and another backend system.
