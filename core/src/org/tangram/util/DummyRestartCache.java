/**
 * 
 * Since Google App Engine provides such a nice persistent cache and we want to generically use this we had to implement
 * the interface for other flavours of tangram as google app engine as well
 * 
 * The file cache adapter moved to the core package because it was not really rdbms or mongo dependent and can also be 
 * used out of the jdo scope. This reasulted in the fact that using modules have to declare it in XML files and cannot
 * be auto-scanned anymore.
